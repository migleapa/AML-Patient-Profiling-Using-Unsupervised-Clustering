# Ex Vivo Drug Response Profiling Reveals Two AML Subgroups with Distinct Kinase Activity, Immune Profiles and Gene Expression Linked to Clinical Survival Outcomes

## Overview

This study employs unsupervised clustering techniques to profile patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on their ex vivo responses to various chemotherapeutic and targeted oncology agents. Corresponding multi-omics datasets are utilized to establish a direct link between the molecular phenotypes of AML and their respective drug response profiles. Furthermore, survival analyses are conducted on the identified patient groups, with validation performed using an external dataset.

## Materials and Methods

### Datasets:<br>
•	Drug Sensitivity Scores (DSS) - measuring the percentage of relative cell growth inhibition.<br>
•	Proliferation rates - representing the change in cell proliferation over time from untreated to treated conditions.<br>
•	Proteomic and phosphoproteomic datasets - samples were analysed using an LC-MS/MS system.<br>
•	Genomic dataset - generated through targeted DNA NGS, focusing on 54 genes commonly mutated in AML.<br>
•	Transcriptomics dataset – consisting of gene counts.<br>
